Punch cards were an early method of programming and data storage, used in mechanical computers and early digital systems. Here are a few examples:

Jacquard Loom (1804)

Used punched cards to control the weaving of fabric patterns.
Each hole in the card corresponded to a specific weaving action.
Herman Hollerithâ€™s Tabulating Machine (1890)

Used for the U.S. Census to process large amounts of data.
Punched cards stored numerical data, allowing sorting and counting.
